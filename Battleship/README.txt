The Future:
   Despite graduating LaSalle and our AP Comp Sci A class, I look forward to
   continuing to develop this game further. As a passion project, I hope to
   add more to the game in the future and potentially over the summer with the
   goal of rebuilding the original Battleship mobile phone game which has currently
   been lost to time.

Goals:
	- Ability to place ships in a setup phase
	- Option to play against a simple AI
	- Clean up graphics
	- Flagship Super-weapons game mode
	- Salvo game mode
	- Music
	- Potentially add animations
	- Potentially add networking for full multiplayer support
